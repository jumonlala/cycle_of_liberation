# Reflection on "The Cycle of Liberation"

In Bobbie Harro’s “Cycle of Liberation,” oppression is framed as a systemic phenomenon that perpetuates inequities by normalizing privilege and marginalizing others. Privileged individuals benefit from these systems, often without awareness, while marginalized groups encounter systemic barriers. This cycle of injustice can only be disrupted through intentional action at both individual and collective levels. Harro emphasizes that a critical step in this cycle occurs when individuals become conscious of the systems of oppression surrounding them, typically sparked by personal experiences. This newfound awareness fosters introspection and encourages individuals to examine their own identities and roles within these power structures.

Similarly, Allan G. Johnson highlights the importance of systemic change and personal responsibility in combating oppression. He urges individuals to engage actively in dialogue and education, learning from both shared and diverse identities. This personal engagement serves as a foundation for greater awareness and pushes for systemic change. Johnson also underscores the significance of building community; while the idea of "coalescing" may initially seem abstract, he concretizes it through examples of forming local committees, hosting discussions on prejudice, and initiating conversations across differing identities. Such community work is essential for creating spaces where individuals can exchange ideas, share experiences, and collaboratively develop strategies to dismantle oppressive systems.

Reflecting on these insights, I recognize my own growth in this area. Unlike my younger self, who often felt compelled to listen silently, I now understand that I have the capacity to initiate meaningful change. Johnson’s suggestion to read literature authored by individuals with shared identities about their experiences with systemic oppression particularly resonated with me. Having been educated primarily in the United States, I realized I had seldom engaged with literature addressing systemic issues relevant to my hometown or by authors from my home country. This gap in understanding has created tension when reflecting on specific forms of oppression in Korea, especially regarding victim-blaming and the trivialization of efforts to challenge systemic injustices. I have often encountered dismissive remarks targeting those visibly addressing inequality.

Johnson's exploration of the fears underlying such reactions marked a turning point for me. He explains that individuals in positions of privilege often fear losing what they possess if they acknowledge their advantages, which drives them to minimize or ridicule the efforts of others. Recognizing this fear has emboldened me; I understand that visibility and vocal advocacy are crucial—not just for my own growth, but for those who have yet to grasp the realities of systemic oppression. Remaining silent would deny others the opportunity to learn and grow, a realization that carries more weight than I initially recognized.

Ultimately, addressing systemic oppression requires both personal and collective action. It involves engaging in difficult conversations, committing to self-education, and actively participating in the creation of change. Through Harro’s cycle of liberation and Johnson’s practical guidance, I have gained clarity on how I can contribute to dismantling systemic oppression by fostering dialogue, building community, and embracing visibility in the pursuit of equity.
